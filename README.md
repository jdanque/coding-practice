# Coding-Practice
Algorithms, solutions and other general utilies used for practice in coding and software development.
Solutions, algorithms or software paradigms contained here are in not guaranteed to be the optimal solution.
These are just my take on these challenges. You are more than welcome (and I recommend) to try and solve them yourself.

### Project Euler

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.
### Cracking the Coding Interview
 
[Cracking the Coding Interview](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/). It's a book by Gayle L. McDowell. Great book for studying the basics and advanced topics used in software engineering interviews. I like it because it tries to be language agnostic and yet effective.
